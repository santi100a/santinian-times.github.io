### The GCS Activity Period For 2023 Is Over, Santinia Closes With An Unexpected Flourish

Today, GCS held a Christmas brunch and a cultural closure for the educational, financial and geopolitical period of 2023. At the
end of the event, Santiago Rojas, king of communist conservative Santinia, took a selfie with Derrick Madison, leader of liberal
Derrickland. This is a stark reminder that officially marks the end of geopolitical polarization at GCS, so hundreds of copies of
this picture were posted in every public square all over the country.
Another astounding resolution happened when King Santiago said goodbye with a strong handshake to his fellow Ninth Fund member
John Solaine, the dictator of liberal Soland. This marked the 2023 brink of international and geopolitical peace and tranquility, which will be pushed forward next year.

If their owners are allies, they will use their corporations to trade and relate.
