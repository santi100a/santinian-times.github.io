### The DRK-20 (aka Super-Madison) Trading Contract Was Resumed Yesterday, Relating The Coalition Leaders And Ending Geopolitical Polarization

Yesterday, the SCP decided to go the route of reconciliation instead of retaliation by resuming relations with Derrick Madison, the dictator of Derrickland and part of the Allied Forces. This destroyed the coalition triad formed when things went tense
between the two nations.

Madison Industries and SuperMagic Industries repaired their contract to trade successfully—Madison Industries approved regeneration of the Super-Madison contract, whilst SuperMagic Industries fixed a few bugs on their side of things.

This, along with our initiatives for a _déténte_ of diplomatic relations between the Ninth Fund ruling class and us, crushed the
geopolitical polarization that lasted since the deletion of the original Super-Madison contract. The three coalitions are no longer
recognized by our government.

"Super-Madison II" was successfully deployed yesterday, as part of the "buffer zone" trading chart, as we start a new period on February 2024.

Superism will likely thrive even more with DRK-20, resembling the original Hyperianist plan; however, full-blown, original Hyperianism remains impossible due to Octofund.
