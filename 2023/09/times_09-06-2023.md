### Upper economy flourishes today as the King's financial victory causes transcendental growth

At the premises of GCS, our sales partner, we just closed many buy orders towards our offerings.
This is due to a victory of our King in the upper economy battlefield against a group of people
sponsoring Mark Antoine, an economist with significant holdings and successful shares at Octofund.
These investors were known as the Antoinists, and Antoine's economic presence was called Antoinism.
We beat him in a benchmarking contest, thus increasing the price of our shares, sinking his, and
receiving a massive swarm of buy orders from certain economists from a niche of upper economy called
"side B." This drove up the price of Oscate, another "side A" Octofund share (which generally follows
market trends) and drove down Mark-32's price (Antoine's flagship product).
