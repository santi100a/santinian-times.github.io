### Happy Flower Day! President Isabella's Birthday Marks the Foundation of the Santinian Union

Today, President Rojas traveled to Isabelgrad and electronically signed a treaty with Sebastian Jimenez and Omar David wherein
the Union of Autonomous Santinian Socialist Federations (UASSF) was created. Here is what happened to each province of the
Socialist Kingdom after the creation of the Santinian Union:

* La Ascension, under the rule of Omar David, became the La Ascension Socialist Santinian Federation (La Ascension Federation).
* Los Robles, under the rule of President Rojas, became the Los Robles Autonomous Socialist Santinian Federation (Los Robles Federation).
* Tejar, under the rule of President Isabella, became the Tejar Socialist Santinian Federation (Tejar Federation).
* Villa Liliana, under the rule of Premier Jimenez, became the Villa Liliana Socialist Santinian Federation (Villa Liliana Federation).

The two presidents sang their anthem and the pre-coronation of President Isabela took place, as she will likely succeed Rojas
after November of 2025. The Presidents enjoyed their reunion at Isabelgrad and partied happily. Although we are no longer a
monarchy, it is a symbolic grant that represents the concession of all presidential powers.
