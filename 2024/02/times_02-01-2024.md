### Today Marks One Year Since the Neo-Santinian Revolution, A Compendium of Reforms to Develop the Country, Rojas Holds Elections for the Outer Party

Exactly one year ago, then King Santiago Rojas started his reforms to move away from Imperial Santinia's expansionist economy to
international trade-based income in present-day Communist Santinia, as the next step in Santinian evolution. 2019 was the year
when Republican Santirigoria morphed into Imperial Santinia, and today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of Communist
Santinia's birth.

At Rojas Plaza, in the vicinity of the Supremacy Palace, Santinian citizens gathered to hear Rojas's speech and hold the first
elections in the country's history, to choose the General Secretary of the Outer Party and General of the Green Army. Mateo
Cabrera won both elections, now holding two important positions in the Party.
