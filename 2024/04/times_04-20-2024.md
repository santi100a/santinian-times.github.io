### The Los Robles Federation Officially Descended Into Civil War, Pablo Galindo and Janna Rodriguez Declare War on President Rojas

Today, Pablo Galindo and Janna Rodriguez have declared Yellow Army membership and staunch opposition to the Santinian socialist
government. They have officially said that they will fight against President Rojas and the Green Army. However, we can see some
differences in the goals of Pablo and Janna — Pablo wants to establish a non-socialist government over the land to restore the
Titan Empire he ruled before the 2019 annexation of Los Robles by President Isabella, and Janna wants to crush the Communist Party
and establish a fascist society. "It's time to fight," said President Rojas. "We the socialists rule, and we always will. It's
showtime—we must show the world who rules! We need to follow socialism in one country—consolidate socialism in the Los Robles
Federation before doing so in countries like the People's Republic of Los Sauces," he also said.
