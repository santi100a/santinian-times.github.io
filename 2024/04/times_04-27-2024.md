### The Green Army Fought the Battle of Pablograd Against the Yellows, But Lost

Today, Matias Gonzalez Alfonso and Geronimo Gonzalez, along with President Rojas and Juan Jose Vazquez, attacked the Yellow
Army-occupied city of Pablograd and fought staunchly against Janna and her divisions. Some people suspect that the battle was
triggered by the removal of Santinian urban planning elements like street name indicators, highway signs, and anti-fascist
propaganda, by the Yellow Army. The Santinian forces, led by General Matias and President Rojas, attacked and tried to take
Janna away. However, they never managed to do so and instead withdrew, replanning the offensive for tomorrow. "We are very
close to winningâ€”we must take Pablograd and we will be almost done," said President Rojas. "The Green Army is superior,
and we will beat the Yellows. Eventually, we'll take them by storm and seize the city. I will grant military decorations to
whoever manages to lead us in defeating them," he also said.
