### The Most Prominent Leaders of the Yellow Army have Surrendered, We Win the Civil War

Janna Rodriguez, Pablo Galindo, Alan Ortega and Valeri Rodriguez, the four major members of the paramilitary force commonly known as the Yellow Army, signed a treaty with the Communist Party wherein they left the Yellow Army and agreed to never engage in activities against us again. This marked the victory of the Greens in the Civil War and put a practical end to it. Pablograd was renamed to Alfonsograd in honor of General Matias Gonzalez Alfonso. "We didn't need help from the Red Union at all," said President Rojas. "We just needed the help of our comrades, and a lot of bravery. We fought very hard yesterday, and Janna decided to surrender to stop the hostilities. Then the others followed suit. The only missing signer is Joshua Cardona and maybe some others. Comrade Matias, you will be getting your decoration soon," he also said. Long live socialism, comrades!
