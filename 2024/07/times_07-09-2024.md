### President Rojas Initiated a Trading Freeze After SG Circle 2's Rejection

Today, President Rojas returned from the international trading break of June. When trying to enter Support Group Circle #2's
trading chatroom, a fatal exception caused unexpected losses, triggering a margin call. The exception was caused by no less
than a disconnection request from Oscarland with a message: "There is a reason as to why we turn our backs at you." Rojas
contacted the Oscarlandic government, which had no qualms confirming that they meant it. "This is the sign," said President Rojas.
"I am canceling all exports to Oscarland. Group 11 financial cushions will be our salvation. The March idyll is no more, long live
self-sustaining Santinia! And the rest of Circle 2 won't do much better either. Let the search for alternatives begin!"
