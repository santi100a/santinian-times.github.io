### GCS Trading Partners send Economic Aid to the Communist Party, Circle 2 is Not Happy

Today, there was an advertising fair of international societies which was attended by Groups 10 and 11 of AIS. As a Group 10
member, Rojas attended with his fellow members. However, GCS also attended the summit, which was a total surprise for Rojas.
Due to Santinia's economic struggles and Rojas's desire to see his former trading partners, he connected to a committee of
GCS participants (the ones that had been known as "Decafund" throughout 2023). They remembered him and, along with participants
from another society, sent around 9.5 million Santinian dollars worth of international points for the purpose of economic aid.
Rojas's foreign policy was frowned upon by Oscarland and allies, who undermined Rojas's GCS patrons.

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime event," said Rojas. "This summit goes to show that we have not been forgotten. We were liked, and
we left an indelible mark on our trading partners. Santinia is admired, it's all a matter of who decides it. Santinia's not a
bad country like SG Circle 2 thinks, we're just in the wrong place. For the well-being of my people, I wish with every candle on
the cake that we could return to GCS, but we can't."
