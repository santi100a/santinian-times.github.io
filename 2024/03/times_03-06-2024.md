### Communist Santinia Has Done Very Well at AIS, But Minimum Total Proceeds Have Been Reached Today

The Santinian Support Group has formally joined multiple allies of Santinia, both old and new. The most relevant new ally of
Communist Santinia is Mr. Oscar Camacho, premier of the Republic of Oscarland. This chairman met Rojas at the March 1st AIS
summit and submitted a Support Group application on March 4th, which was swiftly approved by the Central Committee.
Unfortunately, there have been a few cases of rate limit excesses due to bugs left from the Hyperianist preparation era.
These cases, along with an alleged blockade by Oscarland, communication channel issues and a specificity bug which
caused a network overworking issue, caused a Santinian terminal to crash unexpectedly. Premier Oscar and AIS staff
helped Rojas fix the issue, and everyone at Group 10 was told to keep these quirks in mind while cooperating or trading with
Santinia.

This was extremely ashaming for President Rojas, as it represented a flaw in our known-to-be extremely solid
computer systems. Santinian engineers are looking forward to fix the issue.
