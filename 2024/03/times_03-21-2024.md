### An International Treaty is Setting the Santinian Union's Economy in Checkmate (for now)

An unexpected dip in the rates of trade of new Support Group nations and companies respect to the Santinian Union, as a result
from a number of declarations by multiple members of Group 10, has jeopardized our near future, since we will have to limit HC
connections trading with important actors in the international stage, as per the March Accords signed today. This might bring
stagnation to our economy as these conditions can lower our proceeds by at least 20%. "I love my people—I don't want to
spare any healthcare or communal expense," said President Rojas. "The thing is the situation at AIS is concerning—the last
couple weeks have been consistently closing into returns lower than those throughout February. What scares me the most is
that our economy could start to tank again and we would enter another financial winter," he declared. However, he
also decided to accept the changes and wait for a positive reaction from the international community.
