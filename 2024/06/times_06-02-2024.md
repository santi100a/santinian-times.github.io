### Darwin Castaño Proclaimed the Federal Socialist Republic of Los Sutagaos after President Rojas's Visit

Today, President Rojas entered Sutagaos and chose four people to create the Communist Party of Los Sutagaos.
These people formed the CPLS's Central Committee. Among them, Mr. Darwin Castaño emerged victorious during today's
foundational general elections as the General President of the Central Committee of the CPLS, position which doubles as head of
state. This is our first satellite state—a Santinian dream portrayed in reality, akin to designing a child for the Santinian
Union, a state created with the help of President Rojas from the Santinian Union. "This is the UASSF's child," said President
Rojas. "We long to create a strong Sutagean socialist government that helps the Santinian Union endure and provides a place
for socialists to stay socialist, just in case the Santinian Union weakens or dissolves."
